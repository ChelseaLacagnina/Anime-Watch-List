# Anime-Watch-List
A list of anime's that my husband and I have watched, are in the middle of watching, or want to watch.

The idea for an anime watch list came from me wanting to create something for my husbands birthday. I was initially just going to make a poster with anime’s we have watched, ones we are watching, and ones that we know we want to watch. I created a list of the anime’s that I wanted to include. When starting to gather images and creating the poster, I thought I may want to order the images by genre. I then started an excel spreadsheet including all of the names of the anime’s and genre. I quickly then thought that if I was already making an excel sheet that I would add a few more items. 

I came up with the categories: Anime Title, Genre 1, Genre 2, Japanese Genre, Seasons, Movies, Tags, Poster (Y/N). This last category was just for me to check if I had put the anime image in the poster yet. 

I used Cha GPT-4 to help me fill-in the blanks of my table through the following series of prompts: 

“Pull information from where ever you can find it on the internet to create a table that includes anime name, genre 1, genre 2, japanese genre (seinen, slice of life, shonen, isekai), number of seasons, number of movies, and tags (sad, teen, etc.). Ask me questions for clarification. Include only the following animes: To Your Eternity
Ranking of Kings
Death Note
Death Parade
Bleach
Tokyo Ghoul
Cyberpunk: Edge-runners
Parasyte
Steins Gate
Psycho Pass
Monster
Vinland Saga
A Silent Voice
Your Lie in April
Supernatural: The Animation
Altered Carbon: Resleeved
Ghost in the Shell
Erased
Made in Abyss
Berserk

Shield Hero
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime
Drifting Home
Your Name
One Piece
Hunter X Hunter
Black Butler
The Yakuza's Guide to Babysitting
The Devil is a Part-Timer!”

It then created a table for me including all of the information asked. I then asked it to “Reflect on your first table and tell me if there is anything wrong in the table.” It did so and found two errors and then recreated the table to fix the errors. 

I asked it to reflect once again, “Reflect on the new version of the first part of the table, make corrections for inaccuracies.” It found one more mistake and again recreated the table. I had it search the table to find “any other mistakes” and “as many inaccuracies” as it could. 

I then realized that it was including live action movies, which I decided I did not want. I had it recreate the table again using the following: “Please only include movies if they are animated. Include all of the found inaccuracies. Review for further inaccuracies. Then recreate the first section of the table again.” I did the table in sections to make it easier for Chat GPT-4 to handle. I then did this process for the second and third sections of the table. 

I decided to turn this into an even larger project and ask questions that I could answer from the data that would be helpful for my husband and I when looking at this information. I had Chat GPT-4 come up with a list of seven questions. 

I decided to only use questions one and leave the rest for the time being. 

At this point I decided to show my husband so we could start to collaborate on the project since it was becoming something more than I had originally planned. 

In our discussion of the project it was clear that the layout for genres that I had was not working the way I wanted it to. We looked at the term “genre” and how to best make this more clear. We then came up with the following categories: Anime Title, Demographic, Genre, Sub-Genre, Description, Length (Season), Number of Animated Movies, and Overall Watch Time.

We had Chat GPT-4 recreate out table pulling information from the internet to fill-in each cell. We then went through the table to check and see if there was any mistakes. I fixed the mistakes that I found in the “Demographics” category and I went through some of the “Overall Watch Time”. I then created the “Overall Watch Time” to minutes to make it easier to analyze. I also created another column names “Check” so I can see what lines I have made sure everything is correct in that line. Many of the anime’s have not be check for accuracy in “Overall Watch Time” but seem to be fairly in the range of accurate. 

I further cleaned the data by double checking all of the information to make sure thinks were worded the same way, capitalized the same way and there were no extra spaces. I did this using the tools in Excel for removing extra spaces and filtering for specifics to check. I also made the “Length (Seasons)”, “Number of Animated Movies”, and “Overall Watch Time (Minutes)” into number columns. 

I did my analysis to answer Question 1. To create more questions based off of the newest version of this data I collaborated with Chat GPT-4 using the following prompt: 

“Based on the following column headers of an excel spread sheet, create 5 questions to answer from this dataset that would be helpful for someone watching anime to know. Here are the columns: Anime Title, Demographic, Genre, Sub-Genre,	Description,	Length (Seasons),	Number of Movies, and	Overall Watch Time.”

Chat GPT-4 provided me with the following:

“Here are five questions that could be helpful for someone watching anime, based on the given dataset:

1. Which anime have the shortest and longest overall watch times, and how do these compare across different demographics, genres, and sub-genres? This information can help viewers choose an anime based on the amount of time they have available or their preferred demographic and genre.
2. Which sub-genres are most common within each primary genre, and how does this distribution vary across demographics? Understanding the combinations of primary genres and sub-genres can provide viewers with a better idea of the variety of anime available within their preferred categories.
3. Are there any trends in the length of seasons or the number of movies associated with specific genres or demographics? This information can help viewers understand if certain genres or demographics typically have longer or shorter series, which can be useful when selecting an anime to watch.
4. What are some popular anime titles for each demographic, based on the number of seasons or movies? This can help viewers find highly-regarded anime titles within their preferred demographic group.
5. Can we identify clusters of similar anime titles based on their genre, sub-genre, and demographic? This information can be used to make personalized recommendations for viewers looking for new anime to watch that are similar to their favorite titles.”

I decided to keep question 1 and adapt question 2 from the first set of questions created. From this new set of questions created I decided to keep questions 1, 2, 3, and 5. My set of questions became the following:

Q1: What are the most common genres in the dataset? Are there any trends or patterns
  in the distribution of genres?

---

Q2: What is the distribution of movies and seasons among different demographics?

---

Q3: Which anime have the shortest and longest overall watch times, and how do these compare across different demographics, genres, and sub-genres? 

---

Q4: Which sub-genres are most common within each primary genre, and how does this distribution vary across demographics? 

---

Q5: Are there any trends in the length of seasons or the number of movies associated with specific genres or demographics? 

---

Q6: Can we identify clusters of similar anime titles based on their genre, sub-genre, and demographic?

---

The following steps were used to answer the questions:

**Question 1: “1. What are the most common genres in the dataset? Are there any trends or patterns in the distribution of genres?”** 

To analyze the data in Excel and answer question #1 (What are the most common genres in the dataset? Are there any trends or patterns in the distribution of genres?), I followed these steps:

1. Open Microsoft Excel and copy the entire dataset (all three sections of the table) into a new Excel worksheet.
2. Arrange the dataset in a structured format with column headers such as Anime Title, Genre 1, Genre 2, Japanese Genre, # of Seasons, # of Movies, and Tags.
3. Create two separate pivot tables to count the frequency of each genre in Genre 1 and Genre 2 columns:
    
    a. Select the "Genre 1" column.
    b. Go to the "Insert" tab in Excel and click on "PivotTable."
    c. Make sure the range containing the "Genre 1" column is selected as the source data, and choose where you want the pivot table to be placed (a new worksheet is recommended).
    d. Click "OK."
    e. In the PivotTable Field List, drag the "Genre 1" column header into the "Rows" area and then again into the "Values" area. Excel will automatically calculate the count of each genre.
    f. Repeat steps a-e for the "Genre 2" column.
    
4. Combine the results of both pivot tables to get the total count for each genre:
    
    a. In a new worksheet, list all unique genres from both pivot tables in a single column.
    b. Use the VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH functions to get the counts from both pivot tables for each genre.
    
    1. In the new worksheet where you listed all unique genres from both pivot tables (let's assume this list is in Column A, starting from cell A2), click on cell B2 to find the count of the genre from the first pivot table.
    2. Type the following formula: =IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, Sheet4!$A$3:$B$15, 2, FALSE), 0)
    3. Press Enter to apply the formula. You should now see the count for the genre in cell B2, fetched from the first pivot table.
    4. Click on cell C2 to find the count of the genre from the second pivot table. Type the following formula: =IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, Sheet4!$D$3:$E$18, 2, FALSE), 0)
    5. Press Enter to apply the formula. You should now see the count for the genre in cell C2, fetched from the second pivot table.
    6. Copy the formulas in cells B2 and C2 down the entire column for each unique genre in the list.
    
    c. Add the counts from both pivot tables to get the total count for each genre.
    
5. To sort the combined counts by frequency (total count of each genre), select the two columns containing the genre names and their total counts, and click on the "Sort & Filter" option on the "Home" tab. Choose "Sort Largest to Smallest" (descending order) and select the column with the total counts.

Create a horizontal bar chart to visualize this information through the following steps:

1. In the worksheet where you have the combined counts for each genre (Columns A and C, with genres in Column A and their total counts in Column C), select the range containing the genres and their total counts (e.g., A2:C[last_row]).
2. Go to the "Insert" tab in Excel.
3. In the "Charts" group, click on the "Column or Bar Chart" icon.
4. Choose the "Clustered Bar" chart type.
5. Excel will create a horizontal bar chart using the selected data. You can customize the chart title, axis labels, and other formatting options as needed.

This visualization makes it easy to identify the most common genres and spot any trends or patterns in the distribution of genres, while ensuring that the genre labels remain easily readable.

**Question 2: “2. What is the distribution of movies and seasons among different demographics?”** 

Step 1: Create a PivotTable for Seasons

1. Open your Excel spreadsheet.
2. Select any cell within your data.
3. Click on the 'Insert' tab in the Excel ribbon.
4. Click 'PivotTable' and then click 'OK' to create a new PivotTable in a new worksheet.

Step 2: Sum the Seasons Numeric for each Demographic

1. In the PivotTable Fields pane, drag the 'Demographic' field to the 'Rows' area.
2. Drag the 'Seasons Numeric' field to the 'Values' area. Excel will automatically sum the length of seasons per demographic.
3. Click on the drop-down arrow next to 'Seasons Numeric' in the 'Values' area, and select 'Value Field Settings.' Change 'Summarize value field by' to 'Sum,' and click 'OK.'

The PivotTable displayed the total length of seasons for each demographic. 

Step 3: Create a Pie Chart

1. In the worksheet where you have the combined counts for each genre (Columns A and C, with genres in Column A and their total counts in Column C), select the range containing the genres and their total counts (e.g., A2:C[last_row]).
2. Go to the "Insert" tab in Excel.
3. In the "Charts" group, click on the "Pie Chart" icon.
4. Edit the pie chart to have vibrant colors. Add a title, percentages, and legend.

**Question 3: “3. Which anime have the shortest and longest overall watch times, and how do these compare across different demographics, genres, and sub-genres?”** 

Step 1: Sort data by Overall Watch Time

1. Open your Excel spreadsheet.
2. Select any cell within your data.
3. Click on the 'Data' tab in the Excel ribbon.
4. Click the 'Sort' button.
5. In the 'Sort by' dropdown, select 'Overall Watch Time.'
6. Choose 'Sort on' as 'Cell Values,' then select 'Order' as 'Smallest to Largest' or 'Largest to Smallest' depending on your preference.
7. Click 'OK.'

Now your data is sorted by overall watch time. You can easily identify the shortest and longest overall watch times by looking at the top and bottom rows of the sorted data.

Step 2: Create a PivotTable for Demographics

1. Select any cell within your data.
2. Click on the 'Insert' tab in the Excel ribbon.
3. Click 'PivotTable' and then click 'OK' to create a new PivotTable in a new worksheet.

Step 3: Analyze Overall Watch Time for each Demographic

1. In the PivotTable Fields pane, drag the 'Demographic' field to the 'Rows' area.
2. Drag the 'Overall Watch Time' field to the 'Values' area. Excel will automatically sum the overall watch time per demographic.
3. Click on the drop-down arrow next to 'Overall Watch Time' in the 'Values' area, and select 'Value Field Settings.' Change 'Summarize value field by' to 'Average,' and click 'OK.'

Step 4: Create PivotTables for Genre and Sub-Genre

1. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to create two more PivotTables in new worksheets.
2. For one PivotTable, use 'Genre' instead of 'Demographic' in the 'Rows' area.
3. For the other PivotTable, use 'Sub-Genre' in the 'Rows' area.

Step 5: Create Bar Charts

1. Click anywhere in the Demographic PivotTable.
2. Go to the 'Insert' tab in the Excel ribbon and click 'PivotChart.'
3. Choose a 'Bar' chart type, then click 'OK.'
4. Adjust the chart title, axis titles, and other formatting as needed.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the Genre and Sub-Genre PivotTables.

Step 6: Add Slicers

1. Click on the Demographic PivotTable.
2. Go to the 'PivotTable Analyze' (or 'Analyze') tab in the Excel ribbon and click 'Insert Slicer.'
3. In the 'Insert Slicers' dialog box, check 'Demographic,' 'Genre,' and 'Sub-Genre,' then click 'OK.'
4. Position the slicers next to the Demographic chart.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the Genre and Sub-Genre PivotTables, placing the slicers next to the respective charts.

Step 7: Connect Slicers to All PivotTables

1. Right-click the 'Demographic' slicer, and select 'Report Connections.'
2. In the 'Report Connections' dialog box, check all the PivotTables in the list, then click 'OK.'
3. Repeat steps 1-2 for the 'Genre' and 'Sub-Genre' slicers.

This allows us to have a single worksheet with separate bar charts for Demographic, Genre, and Sub-Genre, along with slicers for each category. We can filter the charts by selecting specific demographics, genres, or sub-genres using the slicers. This way, we can interactively compare the average overall watch times for different groups without combining the data into a single table or graph.

**Question 4: “4. Which sub-genres have the highest number of anime titles within each primary genre, and how does this distribution vary across demographics?”** 

Step 0: Modify the Question to be more clear. 

Change the question from “Which sub-genres are most common within each primary genre, and how does this distribution vary across demographics?” ****to “Which sub-genres have the highest number of anime titles within each primary genre, and how does this distribution vary across demographics?”

4. Adjust the chart title, axis titles, and other formatting as needed. Change the legend formatting. 

This chart can be analyzed to identify clusters of similar anime titles based on their genre, sub-genre, and demographic. The bars in the chart represent genres, while the different colors within each bar represent the count of anime titles for each sub-genre and demographic combination. Similarities can be seen in the patterns of the colored segments within the bars.

As the steps were followed to create charts/graphs for the information, it was added to a Dashboard page in Excel to have all of our findings in one place. Some key findings:

Q1: The graph indicates that the most common genres in our dataset are action, drama, supernatural, and sci-fi. This insight suggests that these are the genres we enjoy the most.

Q2: The graph displays the demographics of the shows and movies we watch. Shonen movies and shows are the most prevalent on our list, with 73% of our TV show seasons and 63% of our movies being Shonen.

Q3: The information presented in the graphs can help viewers choose an anime based on their available time or preferred demographic and genre. For example, selecting the Josei demographic reveals that our dataset only includes romantic dramas for this demographic, and that the average watch time for Josei anime in the dataset is approximately two hours. Anime can be filtered by demographic, genre, or sub-genre to find the appropriate watch time.

Q4: Using this graph to understand the combinations of primary genres and sub-genres can provide viewers with a better idea of the variety of available anime within their preferred categories. Based on the graph, we can conclude that my husband and I greatly enjoy supernatural action anime in the Shonen demographic. We can also see that certain sub-genres correlate more with certain genres, such as sci-fi and cyberpunk.

Q5: This information provides valuable insights into the relationship between season or movie length and specific genres or demographics. These trends can help us make informed decisions when selecting an anime to watch based on our preferences for series length or movie count, or to make personalized recommendations to friends. For the demographics and genres that we have seen more of in our list, we are more open to watching longer series/movies. Conversely, for demographics and genres that we have seen less of in our list, we prefer shorter watch times for series/movies.
Q6: This information can be used to make personalized recommendations for viewers, whether it be ourselves or friends, who are looking for new anime to watch that are similar to our favorite titles. We can see that the distribution of action anime is the largest because our dataset contains more action anime than any other genre.

Overall: Based on the findings presented in these graphs, we now know that my husband and I prefer anime from the Shonen demographic, and we are more likely to add those from the action genre to our watch list. We can use the tools available in the Excel sheet to find an anime that suits our mood (using demographic, genre, and sub-genre) and our time availability (using overall watch time).

While I worked on analyzing the data, my husband saved the excel spread sheet as a CSV file and then uploaded it to a Notion database. We collaborated to add in some extra personal information to this database including: priority, URL, viewing status, and images. To easily look through all of our anime list, he created a gallery view organized by anime title in ascending order and easy to access filters for demographic, genre, and priority. We are still in the process of adding in the new information of priority, URL, viewing status, and images.
